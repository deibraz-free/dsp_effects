### What on earth is this?
Was unable to find a decent method to automatically apply digital sound processing to a sound file, wrote a quick script that uses "numpy" and "scipy" libraries to perform this task. Thought might be useful to someone, might as well share it.

Only tested using .wav files.

Currently only supports mono-channel audio files, sorry stereo-fans.

### Requirements and instalation
- Python 3.6
- needed libraries
